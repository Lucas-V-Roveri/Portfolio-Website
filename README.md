This project was made from scratch and is my official portfolio page.

Everything was done as a way of studying Design, web structure, responsiveness and portability.

If you want, you are free to use it as a template for your own portfolio!

### *üî® Functionalities: *

This portfolio page is designed to be responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
The project is a single paged web-site with four sections, each one with transictions and animations!
